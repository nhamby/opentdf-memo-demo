FROM: ORION PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO)
SUBJECT: (S//F) Project ORION Schedule Breach - AstraDynamics Inc. (ADI)
DATE: 27 OCT 2025

(S//F) This memorandum is to formally notify the Directorate of a critical schedule breach concerning the ORION-3 satellite. As of 26 OCT 2025, the prime contractor for the Guidance and Latching Module (GLM), AstraDynamics Inc. (ADI), has formally declared a 90-day slip on delivery of the flight-ready unit (GLM-03).

(S//F) This slip directly impacts the ORION-3 integration window, currently scheduled to begin 05 JAN 2026. Each day of delay on the GLM delivery maps to a 1.2-day slip in the overall launch readiness date due to cleanroom and testing bay constraints.

(S//F) ADI's official justification for the breach is "unforeseen supply chain delays for radiation-hardened FPGAs." The PMO assesses with low confidence that this is the sole or primary reason for the delay. We suspect underlying manufacturing or quality control failures.

(S//F) The PMO is formally requesting a "show cause" hearing with ADI leadership and has initiated a parallel inquiry with Braxton Labs to assess their capability to surge-produce a compatible GLM unit.
