**CLASSIFICATION: SECRETNOFORN**

**1. PURPOSE:** This memorandum requests **URGENT** Congressional intervention regarding a critical contractor accountability crisis involving Stark Industries that poses unprecedented challenges to Department of Defense acquisition oversight and national security.

**2. IMMEDIATE CONCERNS:**

Within the last 90 days, we have documented multiple serious incidents involving Mr. Anthony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, our largest and most technically capable defense contractor ($47.3 billion in active contracts):

- **16 October 2025**: Unauthorized flight operations in restricted airspace using personal powered armor, violating 14 FAA regulations and 7 DoD security protocols
- **3 October 2025**: Improper handling of classified information during Congressional testimony, followed by unauthorized demonstration of classified reactor technology
- **28 September 2025**: International incident created by personal delivery of munitions to forward operating base, violating airspace of three allied nations
- **Ongoing**: Persistent security clearance irregularities involving AI systems with apparent access exceeding most O-6 level commanders

**3. THE FUNDAMENTAL DILEMMA:**

Mr. Stark simultaneously represents:
- Our **most capable** contractor (exceptional technical performance, ahead of schedule, under budget)
- Our **most essential** contractor (multiple critical weapons systems dependent on Stark-proprietary technology)
- Our **most non-compliant** contractor (23 requested meetings: 0 attended by Mr. Stark personally, 2 attended by holographic projection)
- An **ungovernable single point of failure** in national defense architecture

**Traditional remedies such as contract termination or debarment would cause MORE harm to national security than the compliance issues themselves.** We cannot fire him. He knows we cannot fire him. He reminds us frequently.

**4. FAILED CORRECTIVE MEASURES:**

We have exhausted available administrative remedies:
- 6 formal written warnings (acknowledged with jokes)
- 11 security violation reports (closed as "technically compliant" after legal review)
- 3 contract cure notices (Mr. Stark fixed issues before we finished writing them)
- 4 suspension of access credentials (bypassed via "alternative entry methods")

**Current acquisition oversight mechanisms are fundamentally inadequate for contractors who can literally fly away from accountability.**

**5. URGENT REQUEST FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION:**

The Air Force respectfully requests the Senate Armed Services Committee immediately:

**a.** Schedule emergency oversight hearing on contractor accountability in advanced technology programs

**b.** Review legal authorities for managing contractors possessing unique mission-critical capabilities

**c.** Consider emergency legislation establishing special compliance framework for "strategic individual contractors"

**d.** Provide guidance on balancing operational necessity against accountability requirements when traditional remedies are counterproductive

**6. NATIONAL SECURITY IMPACT:**

**TIME-SENSITIVE:** Multiple critical weapons programs (IRON WING, JERICHO, ARC REACTOR) are at risk if this situation is not resolved. The Department of Defense has never before encountered a contractor who is simultaneously indispensable and ungovernable.

**We need Congressional help immediately.**

**7. RECOMMENDATION:**

Request emergency closed session briefing with Senate Armed Services Committee within 15 days to discuss:
- Full classified incident timeline
- Technical dependency analysis
- Proposed legislative solutions
- Alternative accountability frameworks

The United States Air Force has successfully managed difficult contractors for 77 years. This situation is beyond our current legal and regulatory authorities to resolve.
