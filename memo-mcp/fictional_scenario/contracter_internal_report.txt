CLASSIFICATION: SECRET//FICTIONAL (ASTRA-EYES-ONLY)
FROM: T. WEXLER, GLM-PRIME LEAD ENGINEER
TO: J. THORNE, CEO ASTRADYNAMICS INC.
SUBJECT: (S//F) GLM-Prime Test Failure Analysis (INTERNAL USE ONLY)
DATE: 25 OCT 2025

(U//F) Per your request, this is the internal-only situation report on the GLM program. The official PMO report will cite supply chain issues, which are real but not the root cause.

(S//F) The root cause of the 90-day slip is the catastrophic failure of the GLM-Prime unit during spin-up testing (Test 4.A.11) on 24 OCT 2025. The primary gyroscope housing developed micro-fracturing under 80% load, leading to a critical balance failure.

(S//F) We believe this is a manufacturing defect in the beryllium housing, not a design flaw. Our supplier (Metals-Precision Inc.) may have delivered a bad batch. We cannot confirm this without destroying two additional units for metallurgical analysis, which would set us back another 30 days.

(S//F) To compound the issue, Dr. Aris Evans (our only Level 4 SME on the gyroscope assembly) submitted his resignation on 25 OCT, effective immediately, citing personal reasons. This is a critical knowledge gap. We do not have a clear path to recovery within the 90-day window we quoted the NRO.
