SUBJECT: (S//F) BLUF: ORION Program Delay
DATE: 27 OCT 2025

(S//F) PROBLEM: Key contractor (AstraDynamics) will miss delivery of the ORION-3 satellite Guidance & Latching Module (GLM) by 90+ days.

(S//F) IMPACT: This is a cascading slip. It puts the ORION-3 launch (our primary Pacific-theater signals relay) in jeopardy for Q2 2026. This creates a potential 6-month capability gap in a critical AOR.

(S//F) CONTRACTOR REASON: Supply chain issues (assessed low confidence).

(S//F) ACTUAL REASON: Critical test failure, faulty manufacturing, and the sudden, suspicious loss of their lead engineer (assessed high confidence).

(S//F) THREAT: We have active indications a foreign adversary is exploiting this failure to steal the GLM technology and may be responsible for the personnel loss.

(S//F) ACTION: NRO directed to evaluate surge options, including second-source (Braxton Labs). CI teams are actively investigating the ADI breach and personnel.
