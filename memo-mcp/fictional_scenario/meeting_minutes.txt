DATE: 27 OCT 2025, 1400 HRS
LOCATION: SCIF-3B, NRO HQ

(S//F) ATTENDEES:

GOV'T: Col. Harris (ORION PM), Ms. Thorne (NRO-CI), Mr. Ives (Contracts)

ADI: Mr. Thorne (CEO), Ms. Reid (VP, Engineering)

(S//F) DISCUSSION:

Col. Harris opened the meeting expressing "extreme dissatisfaction" with the 90-day schedule slip and ADI's "opaque and insufficient" justification of 'supply chain issues'.

ADI CEO Mr. Thorne reiterated the supply chain claim.

Col. Harris confronted Mr. Thorne with internal ADI test failure data (REF: ASTRA_INTERNAL_SITREP_GLM) indicating a manufacturing failure, not supply. Mr. Thorne became defensive, stating that was "preliminary, unconfirmed data."

Ms. Thorne (NRO-CI) intervened to ask Mr. Thorne (ADI) about the sudden resignation of Dr. Evans. Mr. Thorne stated it was an "unrelated HR matter."

Col. Harris stated that ADI was officially in breach of contract and that all options, including termination for default and re-compete, are on the table.

(S//F) ACTION ITEMS:

(S//F) ADI to provide a full, un-sanitized root cause analysis for the GLM-Prime test failure by 29 OCT 2025.

(S//F) ADI to provide all network logs and last-known correspondence from Dr. Evans to NRO-CI.

(S//F) Gov't PMO (Col. Harris) to initiate formal contact with Braxton Labs for "parallel path" study.
