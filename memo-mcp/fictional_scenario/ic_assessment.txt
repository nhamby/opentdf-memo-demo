SUBJECT: (S//F) Threat Assessment: Foreign Interest in AstraDynamics Inc.
DATE: 27 OCT 2025

(S//F) We assess with moderate confidence that a foreign intelligence service (FIS) is actively attempting to exploit known delays in the ORION program, specifically targeting AstraDynamics Inc. (ADI).

(S//F) SIGINT analysis from 15-26 OCT 2025 reveals anomalous network traffic originating from known FIS proxies targeting ADI's engineering network. The activity appears focused on exfiltrating diagnostic and testing data related to the Guidance and Latching Module (GLM).

(S//F) Furthermore, HUMINT reports indicate two key ADI engineers with top-level access to the GLM project have been approached with lucrative "consulting" offers from a known FIS front company.

(S//F) The sudden resignation of Dr. Aris Evans, a key GLM engineer, is considered suspicious and is under active investigation. We cannot rule out co-option or duress. The delay at ADI may be partially or wholly manufactured by a foreign adversary to create both a capability gap and an intelligence-gathering opportunity.
