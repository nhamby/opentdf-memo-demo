The `usaf_memo` Quill package takes care of many formatting details for AFH 33-337 official memorandums to let you focus on the content.

**Numbering** Top-level paragraphs like this one are automatically numbered. NEVER manually number your paragraphs.

- Use bullets for hierarchical paragraph nesting. These are automatically numbered as well.
  - Up to five nested levels are supported

**Headings** Do NOT use markdown headings. If you want to title paragraphs/sections, use bold text in-line with the paragraph.
