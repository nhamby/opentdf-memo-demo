MEMORANDUM FOR CHAIRMAN, SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE
FROM: AFMC/CC
4375 Chidlaw Road
Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006
DATE: 22 October 2025
SUBJECT: (U) Contractor Accountability Issues - Stark Industries Defense Contracts

(U) 1. PURPOSE: This memorandum formally requests Congressional oversight and intervention regarding ongoing contractor compliance issues with Stark Industries and its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Anthony Stark, across multiple Department of Defense acquisition programs.
(S//NF) 2. BACKGROUND: Stark Industries currently holds 17 active DoD contracts totaling $47.3 billion, including:

(S) Project IRON WING (Advanced Propulsion): $8.2B
(S) JERICHO Precision Munitions Modernization: $12.7B
(S) ARC REACTOR Power Generation Program: $15.1B
(C) Various R&D and prototype efforts: $11.3B

(S) While Stark Industries consistently delivers technically superior products ahead of schedule and under budget (a phrase I never thought I'd write about a defense contractor), Mr. Stark's personal conduct has created unprecedented security, safety, and diplomatic challenges.
(S//NF) 3. SPECIFIC INCIDENTS (Last 90 Days):
(S//NF) a. Unauthorized Flight Operations (16 Oct 2025):

(S) Mr. Stark conducted unauthorized flight demonstration in restricted airspace using personal powered armor
(S) Violated 14 separate FAA regulations and 7 DoD security protocols
(S) When confronted, cited his contract as "all the authorization I need"
(U) Left autographed photos with tower personnel

(S//NF) b. Classified Information Handling (3 Oct 2025):

(S) During Congressional testimony, Mr. Stark responded to Senator's question about arc reactor specifications by saying "It's classified, Senator, which you'd know if you read the briefing book I sent your intern"
(U) Later admitted he never sent a briefing book
(S) Then demonstrated working miniaturized reactor during lunch break "to prove a point"

(S//NF) c. International Incident (28 Sep 2025):

(S) Mr. Stark personally delivered JERICHO munitions to forward operating base in undisclosed location
(S) Arrived in powered armor, refused military airlift
(S) Flight path violated airspace of three allied nations who were "not properly notified" (his words)
(C) State Department spent 72 hours on damage control

(S//NF) d. Security Clearance Issues (Ongoing):

(S) Mr. Stark's AI system "FRIDAY" appears to have higher security clearance than most O-6 commanders
(S) When asked how AI obtained clearance, Mr. Stark responded: "She earned it"
(S) OPM still investigating

(S//NF) e. Contract Modification Disputes (12 Sep 2025):

(S) After disagreement over testing timeline, Mr. Stark unilaterally "fixed" the schedule by completing six months of testing in one weekend
(U) Submitted 847-page test report on Monday morning
(S) Report was comprehensive, accurate, and made our test team look slow
(U) Test team is now demoralized

(S//NF) 4. BROADER CONCERNS:
(S//NF) a. Acquisition Accountability:

(U) Traditional contractor oversight mechanisms ineffective when contractor can fly away from meetings
(S) Mr. Stark has attended exactly zero required Program Management Reviews, yet somehow knows everything discussed in them
(U) Strongly suspect continued unauthorized network access

(S//NF) b. Chain of Command:

(C) Mr. Stark appears to have personal phone numbers of SECDEF, SECAF, and CSAF
(U) Uses them frequently
(U) Usually while we're trying to formally report his violations

(S//NF) c. Technical Dependency:

(S) Multiple critical weapons systems now dependent on Stark-proprietary technology
(S) Mr. Stark is literally the only person who fully understands arc reactor specifications
(S) This represents unacceptable single-point-of-failure in national defense architecture
(U) When we mentioned this, he said "I'm not planning on going anywhere, relax"
(U) This does not relax us

(S//NF) 5. ATTEMPTED ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS:
(U) We have attempted the following corrective measures:

Formal written warnings: 6 (acknowledged with jokes)
Security violation reports: 11 (closed as "technically compliant" after legal review)
Contract cure notices: 3 (Mr. Stark fixed issues before we finished writing them)
Suspension of access credentials: 4 (bypassed via "alternative entry methods")
Requests for meeting with Mr. Stark to discuss compliance: 23
Meetings actually attended by Mr. Stark: 0
Meetings where Mr. Stark sent holographic projection instead: 2

(S//NF) 6. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:
(S) Mr. Stark is simultaneously:

Our most capable contractor (performance: exceptional)
Our most expensive contractor (though somehow still profitable)
Our most frustrating contractor (compliance: theatrical at best)
Our most essential contractor (national security dependency: critical)

(U) Traditional remedies (contract termination, debarment, etc.) would harm national defense more than help it. We cannot fire him. He knows we cannot fire him. He reminds us frequently that we cannot fire him.
(S//NF) 7. REQUESTED CONGRESSIONAL ACTION:
(U) We respectfully request the Senate Armed Services Committee:

(U) Conduct oversight hearing on contractor accountability in advanced technology programs
(C) Review legal authorities for managing contractors who possess unique mission-critical capabilities
(S) Consider legislation establishing special compliance framework for "strategic individual contractors"
(U) Possibly invite Mr. Stark to testify (though this may backfire spectacularly)
(U) Alternatively, have someone Mr. Stark actually respects talk to him (recommendations welcome)

(U) 8. CONCLUSION:
(S//NF) The United States Air Force has successfully managed difficult contractors for 77 years. We have dealt with cost overruns, schedule delays, technical failures, and every flavor of corporate dysfunction imaginable. We have never before encountered a contractor who is simultaneously indispensable and ungovernable.
(U) We need help.
(U) Respectfully submitted,
MICHAEL T. HARRIS, General, USAF
Commander, Air Force Materiel Command
