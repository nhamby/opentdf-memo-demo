**PURPOSE:** This memorandum requests immediate Congressional intervention regarding unprecedented contractor compliance issues with Stark Industries that threaten both acquisition accountability and national security.

**CRITICAL SITUATION:** Stark Industries holds $47.3 billion across 17 active DoD contracts, including advanced propulsion, precision munitions, and next-generation power systems. While contractor performance is exceptional (ahead of schedule, under budget, technically superior), the Chief Executive Officer's conduct has created an ungovernable situation.

**REPRESENTATIVE INCIDENTS (Last 90 Days):**

Unauthorized flight operations in restricted airspace using personal powered armor, violating 14 FAA regulations and 7 DoD security protocols.

Improper handling of classified information during Congressional testimony, followed by unauthorized demonstration of classified technology.

International incident involving unsanctioned flight through allied airspace during munitions delivery, requiring 72 hours of State Department damage control.

Unilateral contract modifications and systematic bypass of security protocols.

**THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:** Traditional contractor oversight mechanisms are ineffective when the contractor possesses unique mission-critical capabilities and can physically bypass security measures. We have attempted 6 formal warnings, 11 security violation reports, and 3 contract cure notices. All administrative remedies have proven inadequate.

**CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY RISK:** Multiple weapons systems are now dependent on Stark-proprietary technology that only one individual fully understands. This represents an unacceptable single-point-of-failure in national defense architecture.

**REQUESTED ACTION:** The Air Force Materiel Command requests the Senate Armed Services Committee conduct immediate oversight hearings and consider legislation establishing a special compliance framework for strategic individual contractors who are simultaneously indispensable and ungovernable.

**BOTTOM LINE:** In 77 years of managing defense contractors, we have never encountered this situation. **We need Congressional help.**
